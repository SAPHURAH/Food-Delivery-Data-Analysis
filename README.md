## Project Overview
This project represents my second step in data analysis using Excel. It focuses on analyzing food delivery customer data to uncover insights about purchasing behavior. The dataset includes various attributes such as date, region, delivery person, customer ID, food item, cost price, and selling price. Upon reviewing the data, I found that it was already clean and well-organized, which allowed me to dive straight into the analysis. I created pivot tables and built a dashboard to visually represent my findings.

## Objectives
The main goals of this project are:
- To analyze regional sales trends in food delivery.
- To explore customer characteristics and their impact on purchasing behavior.
- To provide a clear, visual summary of the data using a dashboard.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains the following key columns:
- **Date**: The date of the food order.
- **Region**: The geographical region where the order was delivered.
- **Delivery Person**: The name of the person who delivered the order.
- **Customer ID**: A unique identifier for each customer.
- **Food Item**: The specific item ordered.
- **Cost Price**: The price at which the food item was purchased.
- **Selling Price**: The price at which the food item was sold.

## Methodology

### Pivot Table Analysis:
- **Sales by Region**: This pivot table summarizes total sales across different regions, identifying which areas generate the most revenue. This insight helps target marketing efforts and optimize delivery logistics.

- **Top Food Items**: This table highlights the most frequently ordered food items, providing valuable insights into customer preferences and potential menu enhancements.

- **Profit Analysis**: This pivot table presents a summary of profit margins by food item, illustrating which items are the most profitable and warrant further promotion.

### Dashboard:
- I created a visual dashboard in Excel to display key insights such as:
  - Total sales by region.
  - Top 10 food items ordered.
  - Profit margins across different food items.

## Key Insights
- **Regional Sales Trends**: Certain regions show higher sales volumes, indicating areas of strong demand that could be further targeted for marketing.

- **Popular Food Items**: The analysis revealed specific food items that are consistently popular, suggesting opportunities for promotional efforts or menu adjustments.

- **Profitability**: Identifying the most profitable food items can guide strategic decisions in inventory and marketing.

## Conclusion
This project has been a rewarding experience in my journey toward becoming a data scientist. With the data already cleaned and organized, I was able to focus on exploring the insights through pivot tables and visually communicating my findings via a dashboard. I'm excited to continue honing my skills and applying them to real-world scenarios.
